This website collects ExNLP datasets. It started with the paper [Teach Me to Explain: A Review of Datasets for Explainable NLP](https://tbd), and we hope it will evolve as new datasets are collected.

Datasets are grouped by explanation type: 

* [Highlights](https://exnlpdatasets.github.io/exnlp-datasets/highlights/)
* [Free-text Explanations](https://exnlpdatasets.github.io/exnlp-datasets/freetext/)
* [Structured Explanations](https://exnlpdatasets.github.io/exnlp-datasets/structured/)
